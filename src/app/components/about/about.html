      ICA Cooperative Cultural Heritage (CCH) Programme
    </h1>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
      The ICA's ambitious undertaking to establish a <strong>Cooperative Cultural Heritage (CCH)</strong> inscription program signifies a recognition of the cooperative movement's enduring legacy and its unique contribution to global human history and, through its continuing service, to sustainable development.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
      This initiative aims to systematically identify, document, and safeguard the tangible and intangible manifestations of cooperative principles across continents.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
      In <strong>2025</strong>, the ICA-CCH programme launched information about <strong>twenty-five physical sites</strong> that embody the culture of cooperation at the local and national levels. This initiative is a concrete start towards the long-term goal of mapping cooperative experiences worldwide, the sum of all of which will reveal
      <em>“Our Shared Cooperative Identity and Cultural Heritage”</em>.

  <!-- Programme Goals -->
  <section class="mb-12">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-center mb-8 text-[#7a004a]">The Three Main Goals</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4 text-lg">
      <li>
        Identifying, through consultations with WG members, and recognizing, through a digital map of the world, <strong>25 geographical sites of undisputed cooperative heritage</strong> at the inter/national level.
      </li>
      <li>
        Developing, through consultations with cultural heritage professionals and legal experts, the first version of <strong>international standards</strong> and exploring potential certification mechanisms concerning Cooperative Cultural Heritage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Launching a <strong>global communications and public-relations campaign</strong> to make widely known the contribution and potential of cooperatives to culture and sustainable development. This launch is expected to open the long-term objective of the ICA to facilitate the collection of information and key insights about those places and practices of cooperation that are not well known.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-lg mt-4 italic">
      The objective is indeed to go back to the first principles of the ICA, which is to make known the co-operators of the world, and their work, globally.
